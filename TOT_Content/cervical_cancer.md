Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally. Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Women living with HIV are 6 times more likely to develop cervical cancer compared to women without HIV. 

### Causes:
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection which can affect the skin, genital area and throat. Almost all sexually active people will be infected at some point in their lives, usually without symptoms.
In most cases the immune system clears HPV from the body. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV can cause abnormal cells to develop, which go on to become cancer.

Persistent HPV infection of the cervix (the lower part of the uterus or womb, which opens into the vagina  if left untreated, causes 95% of cervical cancers. Typically, it takes 15–20 years for abnormal cells to become cancer, but in women with weakened immune systems, such as untreated HIV, this process can be faster and take 5–10 years.

### Prevention:
Being vaccinated at age 9–14 years is a highly effective way to prevent HPV infection, cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers.
Screening from the age of 30 (25 years in women living with HIV) can detect cervical disease, which when treated, also prevents cervical cancer.
At any age with symptoms or concerns, early detection followed by prompt quality treatment can cure cervical cancer.
Other important ways to prevent HPV infection include:

* being a non-smoker or stopping smoking
* using condoms
* voluntary male circumcision

Good To Know:
As of 2023, there are 6 HPV vaccines available globally. All protect against the high-risk HPV types 16 and 18, which cause most cervical cancers and have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing HPV infection and cervical cancer.

As a priority, HPV vaccines should be given to all girls aged 9–14 years, before they become sexually active.

### Breast Cancer.
Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal.
Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milk-producing lobules of the breast. The earliest form (in situ) is not life-threatening and can be detected in early stages. Cancer cells can spread into nearby breast tissue (invasion). This creates tumours that cause lumps or thickening. 

Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs (metastasize). Metastasis can be life-threatening and fatal.

### Who Is At Risk:
Approximately 99% of breast cancers occur in women and 0.5–1% of breast cancers occur in men.

Certain factors increase the risk of breast cancer including increasing age, obesity, harmful use of alcohol, family history of breast cancer, history of radiation exposure, reproductive history, tobacco use and postmenopausal hormone therapy.

Family history of breast cancer increases the risk of breast cancer, but most women diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a known family history of the disease. Lack of a known family history does not necessarily mean that a woman is at reduced risk.

### Signs and Symptoms:
Most people will not experience any symptoms when the cancer is still early hence the importance of early detection.

Breast cancer can have combinations of symptoms, especially when it is more advanced. The symptoms of breast cancer can include:
a breast lump or thickening, often without pain 
change in size, shape or appearance of the breast
dimpling, redness, pitting or other changes in the skin
change in nipple appearance or the skin surrounding the nipple (areola) 
abnormal or bloody fluid from the nipple.

### Self-examination:

Breast self-exam, or regularly examining your breasts on your own, can be an important way to find breast cancer early, when it’s more likely to be treated successfully. 

### How to visually examine your breasts
Remove your upper garments, including your bra.
Stand squarely in front of a large mirror and place your hands on your hips.
Look at your breasts to check for new changes in their symmetry, size, shape or volume.
Look at your breast skin to check for dimpling, pitting, puckering or redness.
Look at your nipples to check for new changes in their appearance, such as inversion or unusual discharge.
Lift both arms over your head and repeat the visual inspection of your breasts.

### How to manually examine your breasts while standing:
Remain standing in front of the mirror.
Use your right hand to check your left breast.
Use the pads of your three middle fingers to feel your breast tissue by firmly pressing on every part of your breast and underarm area; follow a circular pattern to ensure that no area is missed.
Check for lumps, masses, thickened areas, knots and changes in texture.
Gently squeeze your nipple to check for unusual discharge.
Repeat the manual inspection using your left hand to check your right breast.

### How to manually examine your breasts while lying down:
Lie face up on a bed or couch, place a pillow under your left shoulder and place your left hand behind your head.
Use your right hand to check your left breast using the same techniques outlined above.
Repeat the manual inspection while lying down using your left hand to check your right breast.

Researchers estimate that up to 40% of breast cancers are initially detected by a woman who felt a lump while performing a breast self-exam. Even so, the effectiveness of breast self-exams as a standalone screening method for breast cancer is subject to debate within the general medical community. Self-exams are not foolproof, and many breast cancers are found through other methods, such as mammography.
