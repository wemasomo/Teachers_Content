Contraception refers to the deliberate use of various methods and devices to prevent pregnancy during sexual intercourse. These methods work by either preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg or by inhibiting ovulation altogether. Contraception plays a vital role in reproductive health by allowing individuals and couples to plan if and when they want to have children. 

There are several types of contraception methods available, ranging from barrier methods like condoms to hormonal methods such as birth control pills and contraceptive implants. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) like intrauterine devices (IUDs) and injections also offer effective and convenient options for preventing pregnancy.

## Condoms (Male)
** Overview **

* __Description__: Male condoms are a barrier contraceptive method that effectively prevents both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
* __Function__: They are designed to collect semen and prevent it from entering the partner's body during intercourse. Male condoms are suitable for use during vaginal, anal, and oral sex.
* __Convenience__: Ideal for unplanned sex as they require no prior preparation and are easy to apply.
* __Accessibility__: Condoms are available for free at many medical centers and are widely sold in pharmacies and convenience stores.

## How to Use

* __Application__: Carefully remove the condom from its wrapper, ensuring not to tear it with sharp objects. Pinch the tip of the condom to leave a small space for semen collection, then unroll it over the erect penis.
* __Effectiveness__: Each condom is for single-use only. It provides protection as long as it remains intact during intercourse. Using a condom consistently and correctly greatly reduces the risk of pregnancy and STIs.
* __Important__Important: Using the condom correctly from start to finish of intercourse is crucial. Removing the condom before ejaculation or late application increases the risk of pregnancy and STI transmission.

## Side Effects:
* __None__: Male condoms generally have no significant side effects.
* __Alternative__: Individuals sensitive to latex can use non-latex condoms made from materials like polyurethane or polyisoprene.

## Additional Information:
* __Portability__: Condoms are compact and easy to carry in wallets, pockets, or purses.
* __Effectiveness__: They are a reliable method of contraception when consistently used and applied correctly.
You should be confident about using them or asking your partner to use them.

# Condoms (Female)
**Overview**

* __Description__: Female condoms, often referred to as Femidoms, are an internal barrier method of contraception that protects against both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
* __Material__: Made from thin polyurethane, female condoms are worn inside the vagina to prevent sperm from reaching the womb.
* __Availability__: They are available for free at some medical centers and can also be purchased from pharmacies.

## How to Use:
* __Preparation__: Remove the condom from its package, being careful not to tear it. Squeeze the smaller ring at the closed end and insert it deep into the vagina.
* __Insertion__: Ensure the larger ring at the open end covers the area around the vaginal opening.
* __During Intercourse__: Guide the penis into the condom to ensure proper protection. After intercourse, twist the outer ring to keep semen inside the condom, then gently pull it out.


## Side Effects:

* __None__: Female condoms generally have no significant side effects.
* __Alternative__: They are suitable for individuals with latex allergies.

** Additional Information **

* __Reminder__: Keep female condoms on hand for anticipated sexual encounters to ensure readiness.
* __Empowerment__: They provide control over contraception and protection against STIs when used correctly and consistently.

# Pill
**Overview**

* __Description__: The pill is a small, round tablet that releases a progestogen hormone, which helps prevent pregnancy.
* __Benefits__: It may alleviate premenstrual symptoms and painful periods.

## Usage:
* __Daily Intake__: Take one pill daily at the same time each day. Each pack contains 28 pills with no break between packs.
* __Effectiveness__: Immediate protection against pregnancy if started on the first day of your period each month.
* __Consistency__: Missing pills or taking them late can increase the risk of pregnancy. Long-lasting contraception options are available for those who prefer alternatives.

## Side Effects:

* __Common__: Rashes, breast tenderness, nausea/vomiting, stomach upset, weight changes, headaches, and mood changes may occur. These typically subside after a few months of use.
* __Serious__: Serious side effects are rare.

## Important Notes:
* __Fertility__: Fertility returns to normal once pill usage is stopped, allowing pregnancy.
* __STI Protection__: The pill does not protect against STIs. Concurrent use of condoms is advised for STI protection.

# Emergency Pill
**Overview**

* __Description__: Also known as the ‘morning after pill’, emergency contraception prevents pregnancy after unprotected sex.
* __Types__: Two types of hormonal emergency contraception are available: one to be taken within three days and another within five days of unprotected sex.
* __Availability__: Widely accessible at pharmacies without prescription.

## Usage:
* __Timing__: The effectiveness of emergency contraception depends significantly on how soon it is taken after unprotected sex. It is most effective when taken as soon as possible after intercourse and within 72 hours (3 days) for most types, though some formulations may be effective up to 5 days afterward.
* __Handling Vomiting__: Seek medical advice if vomiting occurs within two hours of taking the pill, as another dose may be needed.
* __How It Works__: It works by preventing or delaying ovulation (release of an egg from the ovaries).

## Side Effects:
* __Common__: May cause nausea, dizziness, tiredness, headaches, tender breasts, abdominal pain, and irregular periods.
* __Impact on Menstrual Cycle__: Repeated use may disrupt regular menstrual cycles.

**Important Notes**

* __STI Protection__: Does not protect against STIs or HIV. Condoms should be used for STI protection.

**Non-Hormonal Coil (Copper IUD)**

* __Description__: A small T-shaped device placed in the womb for long-acting contraception.
* __Removability__: Easily removable when pregnancy is desired or for alternative contraception methods.

**Hormonal Coil (Mirena IUD)**

* __Description__: A T-shaped plastic device releasing Levonorgestrel, a progestin hormone, in the womb.

## How To Use:
* __Suitability__: Most women can use the IUD; suitability is assessed based on family and medical history.
* __Not Suitable For__: Women with heavy periods, copper allergies, pelvic infections, unexplained vaginal bleeding, or fibroids.

## Side Effects:

* __Common__: Cramps, spotting/bleeding, heavier or more painful periods (often temporary).
* __Temporary Irregularities__: Irregular bleeding for up to six months.

**Important Notes**

* __STI Protection__: Does not protect against STIs or HIV; condoms are advised for STI protection.

# Injection
**Overview**

# Withdrawal
**Overview**

* __Description__: Natural contraception where the man withdraws before ejaculation to prevent sperm entering the vagina.
* __Effectiveness__: Not a reliable method due to pre-ejaculate fluid potentially containing sperm.

## How To Use:
* __Execution__: Requires precise timing to withdraw before ejaculation.
* __Considerations__: Ejaculation's unpredictability and pre-ejaculate's sperm content affect reliability.

**Side Effects**

* __Risk of Pregnancy__: Inaccurate timing can lead to pregnancy.

**Important Notes**

* __Suitability__: Suitable if both partners agree and are comfortable, but condoms are essential for STI protection.
