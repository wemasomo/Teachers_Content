# Course Title: Comprehensive Overview of Common Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)

__Introduction: Understanding the Importance of STI Awareness__

![](https://)

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a significant public health concern worldwide, especially among young people aged 15-49. This course aims to provide a detailed understanding of various STIs, their symptoms, testing, treatment, and prevention methods. Through this training, participants will be equipped with the knowledge to educate others, promote safe sexual practices, and reduce the spread of STIs.

## Module 1: Overview of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)

STIs are infections transmitted through sexual contact, caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. More than 1 million curable STIs are acquired daily worldwide, with the majority being asymptomatic. STIs can also be transmitted during pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and through infected blood products.

### Impact on Health

Untreated STIs can lead to severe consequences, including neurological and cardiovascular diseases, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirths, and an increased risk of HIV.

**Common Symptoms of STIs**
Most STIs are asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they may include:

* Vaginal or urethral discharge
* Genital ulcers
* Lower abdominal pain

## Module 2: Specific Sexually Transmitted Infections

### 2.1 Chlamydia

1. What is Chlamydia?

Chlamydia, caused by bacteria, is the most common STI. It often presents no symptoms but can cause painful urination and discharge in both men and women. In men there will be a discharge from penis, while in women, drainage from the vagina and spot bleeding can occur when having intercourse

2. Testing and Treatment

Testing involves a urine test for men and a swab test for women. Chlamydia is easily treated with antibiotics like penicillin. Untreated Chlamydia can lead to chronic pain and infertility. If chlamydia goes untreated, girls can get abdominal pain that never goes away. Boys can get pain and inflammation in the testicles. 

3. Prevention

Condoms are the only protection against Chlamydia. It's essential to inform and treat partners to prevent reinfection.

### 2.2 HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)

1. What is HIV?

HIV damages the immune system, leading to AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). It is transmitted primarily through unprotected sexual contact, but also through blood and other body fluids.

2. Transmission

Most people diagnosed with HIV acquire the virus through unprotected vaginal or anal sex.It may also be possible to catch HIV through unprotected oral sex, but the risk is much lower.HIV is not passed on easily from one person to another. The virus does not spread through the air like cold and flu viruses.
HIV lives in the blood and in some body fluids. To get HIV, one of these fluids from someone with HIV has to get into your blood.The body fluids that contain enough HIV to infect someone are:

* Semen
* Vaginal Fluids including menstrual blood
* Breast Milk
* Blood
* Lining Inside the Anus
* Other bodily fluids like saliva, sweat or urine, do not contain enough of the virus to infect another person.

3. Symptoms

Early symptoms may include fever, headache, rash, and sore throat. As the infection progresses, symptoms like swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, and chronic illnesses may develop.

4. Treatment

While there is no cure for HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the main treatment. ART helps control the virus, improves quality of life, and reduces the risk of transmission. Regular medical care and adherence to ART can allow individuals with HIV to live long, healthy lives.

5. Prevention

HIV can be prevented by using condoms and through education on safe sexual practices. Awareness is crucial, especially in areas with high infection rates like Kenya, where young women are particularly at risk.

### 2.3 Genital Warts (HPV)

* What are Genital Warts?

Genital warts, caused by HPV, are small, whitish growths that may appear around the rectum, vagina, or mouth. They are difficult to detect and treat.

* Testing and Treatment

Warts can be treated with brushing, freezing, or laser therapy, but may recur.

* Prevention

Vaccination against HPV and consistent condom use can reduce the risk.

### 2.4 Syphilis

* What is Syphilis?

Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum. It progresses through stages if untreated, starting with painless sores (chancres), followed by a rash, and potentially leading to severe complications affecting the heart, brain, and other organs.

* Symptoms

Primary syphilis manifests as a painless sore at the site of infection (genitals, anus, mouth). Secondary syphilis presents with a rash on the palms, soles, or trunk, along with flu-like symptoms. Late-stage syphilis can cause serious health issues years after infection.

* Testing and Treatment

Syphilis is diagnosed through blood tests and can be cured with antibiotics, particularly penicillin.

* Prevention

Condoms reduce the risk, but sores not covered by condoms can still spread the infection.

### 2.5 Hepatitis B

* What is Hepatitis B?

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic liver diseases.It is transmitted through contact with infectious blood or bodily fluids.

* Symptoms

Many people are asymptomatic initially. Acute illness can cause fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Chronic infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.

* Testing and Treatment

Testing involves blood tests to detect Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies. Treatment aims to manage symptoms and prevent complications, but chronic Hepatitis B may require antiviral medication.

* Prevention

Vaccination is highly effective. Safe sex practices and avoiding the sharing of needles are essential.

### 2.6 Gonorrhea

* What is Gonorrhea?

Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Symptoms in men include painful urination and discharge from the penis. Women may experience painful urination, vaginal discharge, and bleeding between periods. It can also infect the throat and rectum.

* Testing and Treatment

Testing involves a urine sample or swab, and treatment is with antibiotics. However, drug-resistant strains are emerging.

* Prevention

Condoms are effective in preventing transmission. Prompt treatment is necessary to prevent reinfection. Secondary syphilis presents with a rash on the palms, soles, or trunk, along with flu-like symptoms. Late-stage syphilis can cause serious health issues years after infection.

* Testing and Treatment

Syphilis is diagnosed through blood tests and can be cured with antibiotics, particularly penicillin.

* Prevention

Condoms reduce the risk, but sores not covered by condoms can still spread the infection.

### 2.6 Human Papillomavirus (HPV)

* What is HPV?

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection. Certain strains of HPV can cause genital warts, while others may lead to cervical, throat, and other cancers.

* Symptoms

HPV often has no symptoms, making it hard to detect. When symptoms do occur, they may include warts on the genitals or surrounding areas. In more severe cases, HPV can lead to cancerous growths.

* Prevention

Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent HPV. Regular screenings, such as Pap smears for women, can detect early changes in the cervix caused by HPV. Safe sexual practices, including condom use, also help reduce the risk of infection.

* Treatment

While there is no cure for HPV, treatments focus on managing symptoms. Warts can be treated with topical medications, cryotherapy, or surgery. Regular follow-ups are crucial for managing any precancerous changes caused by the virus.

### 2.7 Trichomoniasis

* What is Trichomoniasis?

Trichomoniasis is caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. It is one of the most common curable STIs worldwide.

* Symptoms

In women, symptoms include vaginal itching, burning, and a frothy yellow-green vaginal discharge. Men may experience itching or irritation inside the penis and mild discharge.

* Testing and Treatment

Testing involves a swab of vaginal fluid or urine sample. Trichomoniasis is treated with antibiotics such as metronidazole or tinidazole.

* Prevention

Condoms reduce the risk, and simultaneous treatment of partners is essential.
