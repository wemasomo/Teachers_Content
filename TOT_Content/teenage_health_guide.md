Welcome to the Teenage Health Guide on Understanding Menstruation! Puberty is a time of many changes, and one of the most significant changes for girls is the start of their menstrual cycle. This guide will help you understand what the menstrual cycle is, what to expect, and how to manage it.

## Menstrual Cycle

**What Is The Menstrual Cycle?**
![Cycles](https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/women-climacteric-concept_23-2148653839.jpg?t=st=1721847275~exp=1721850875~hmac=d216bfb04f2469174ff864d8f6bedc0c9554f16fb654856612e851ed464aca96&w=826)
The menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of a woman’s period bleeding to the day before her next period. The length of the menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman, but the average cycle length is 28 days. Some regular menstrual cycles can vary and be about 21 to 40 days, and this is normal.

## Phases of the Menstrual Cycle
The menstrual cycle is divided into four main phases: the menstrual phase, the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. Each phase is characterized by specific hormonal changes and physiological events. Understanding these phases helps in comprehending the entire menstrual cycle and managing its effects.

### 1. Menstrual Phase
__Duration__: Days 1-5 (varies among individuals)

**What Happens**

* The menstrual phase begins on the first day of menstruation, which is when the uterine lining, known as the endometrium, is shed through the vagina.
* The shedding of the uterine lining results in menstrual bleeding, which can last between 3 to 7 days.
* During this phase, levels of estrogen and progesterone are low, causing the endometrial lining to break down and be expelled from the body.

**Key Points**

* Menstrual bleeding is composed of blood, mucus, and cells from the endometrial lining.
* Menstrual flow can vary in volume, color, and texture.

### 2. Follicular Phase
__Duration__: Days 1-14 (varies, but often overlaps with the menstrual phase for the first few days)

**What Happens**

* The follicular phase starts on the first day of menstruation and continues until ovulation.
* The pituitary gland releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the ovaries to produce around 5 to 20 follicles.
* Each follicle contains an immature egg. Usually, only one follicle will mature into an egg, while the rest are reabsorbed.
* The growing follicle produces estrogen, which causes the endometrial lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for a possible pregnancy.

**Key Points**

* Rising estrogen levels signal the body to prepare for ovulation.
* The increase in estrogen also stimulates the production of luteinizing hormone (LH).

### 3. Ovulation

__Duration__: Midpoint of the cycle, typically around Day 14 in a 28-day cycle

**What Happens**

* Ovulation occurs around the middle of the menstrual cycle, triggered by a surge in LH.
* The mature follicle releases an egg from one of the ovaries.
* This egg then travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus.
* The egg is viable for fertilization for about 12 to 24 hours.

**Key Points**

* Ovulation is the most fertile period of the menstrual cycle.
* Some women may experience mild pain or discomfort, known as mittelschmerz, during ovulation.

### 4. Luteal Phase

__Duration__: Days 15-28 (varies among individuals)

**What Happens**

* After ovulation, the empty follicle transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum.
* The corpus luteum secretes progesterone and some estrogen, which maintain the thickened endometrial lining.
* If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum breaks down, leading to a decrease in progesterone and estrogen levels.

**Key Points**

* The drop in hormone levels signals the body to shed the uterine lining, leading to the start of the menstrual phase.
* The luteal phase is often associated with premenstrual symptoms (PMS), such as bloating, mood swings, and breast tenderness.

## Summary of Hormonal Changes

* FSH: Stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles in the follicular phase.
* Estrogen: Peaks during the late follicular phase and is responsible for the thickening of the endometrial lining.
* LH: Surge triggers ovulation around the midpoint of the cycle.
* Progesterone: Dominates the luteal phase, maintaining the endometrial lining in preparation for a possible pregnancy.

# When Does Your Period Start?

Most girls start their periods when they're about 12 years old, but they can start as early as 8. The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones. When a girl starts her period, it's a sign that her body is now able to conceive. Therefore, it's important to also know about getting pregnant and contraception methods. Irregular periods aren't always a sign of a problem as the menstrual cycle can vary from person to person. Some women do not always have a regular menstrual cycle. Their period may be early or late, and how long it lasts and how heavy it is may vary each time. After puberty, many women develop a regular cycle with a similar length of time between periods but it's not uncommon for it to vary by a few days each time.

# What Happens During the Menstrual Cycle?

A period is made up of blood and the uterine lining. The first day of a woman's period is day 1 of the menstrual cycle. Some women bleed more heavily during the first day of their period. In each cycle, rising levels of the hormone estrogen cause one of the two ovaries to develop and release an egg from the ovary which is known as ovulation. The egg travels through the fallopian tubes to the uterus. The uterus lining starts to thicken in the second half of the cycle and if fertilization of the egg by a sperm does not occur then the egg is reabsorbed into the body, and the uterine lining comes away and leaves the body as period blood (the menstrual flow). The time from the release of an egg to the start of a period is around 10 to 16 days.

# What If My Period Is Irregular?

Some women experience irregular periods and some common causes for this can be:

* Puberty: Your periods might be irregular for the first year or two.
* Menopause: Usually between the ages of 45 and 55.
* Early pregnancy: Take a pregnancy test in case of a late or missed period.
* Hormonal contraception: Some types, such as the contraceptive pill, can cause changes to the menstrual cycle.
* Lifestyle factors: Extreme weight loss or weight gain, excessive exercise, or stress can also be factors.
* Medical conditions: Conditions like endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can lead to irregular cycles.

# Menstrual Pain

![Pains](https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/menstruation-flat-design-concept_1284-70050.jpg?t=st=1721848206~exp=1721851806~hmac=37e88c883754938e199adb72950fada77e069453c3e6d1843a9e8025be887210&w=1060)

You may experience pain during menstruation, which is common and a normal part of the menstrual cycle. Most women get it at some point in their lives. It's usually felt as painful muscle cramps in the abdomen which can spread to the back and thighs. The pain sometimes comes in intense spasms, while at other times it may be dull but more constant. Period pain usually starts when your bleeding begins, although some women have pain several days before the start of their period. It's usually at its worst when your bleeding is heaviest. Young girls often have period pain when they first get their periods.

## When Does It Happen?

Period pain happens when the muscular wall of the uterus tightens (contracts). Mild contractions continually occur in your womb, but they're usually so mild that most women cannot feel them. During your period, the wall of the uterus starts to contract to help the uterine lining shed as part of your period. When the uterine walls contract, it compresses the blood vessels lining the uterus.

## How To Reduce The Pain?

To reduce the pain, you could try:

* Over-the-counter painkillers.
* Stopping smoking.
* Light, circular massage around your lower abdomen.
* Relaxing activities and gentle movement to distract from pain.
* Using hot water bottles.
* Applying topical painkillers.

## Why Is My Period Late?

There are many reasons why a woman may miss her period or why periods might stop altogether. Pregnancy is a common reason why periods unexpectedly stop. You might miss a period every so often if you're taking the contraceptive pill. This is not usually a cause for concern. Periods can also sometimes stop as a result of a medical condition, such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, an overactive thyroid, or premature menopause. The average age for menopause, when periods stop, is 50 to 55 years.


The most common reasons for missed periods include:

* Pregnancy
* Stress
* Sudden weight loss
* Being overweight
* Doing too much exercise
* Taking the contraceptive pill
* Menopause
* Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

## Menstrual Blood Colour

During menstruation, the body sheds tissue and blood from the uterus through the vagina. This bloody discharge can vary from bright red to dark brown or black depending on how old it is. Hormonal changes and health conditions can also affect the colour and texture of period blood. Hormonal changes, as well as a person’s diet, lifestyle, age, and environment, can all cause variations in period blood. Period blood can vary from bright red to dark brown according to changes in flow.

![Flow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uydCmYpZHkzOpdCOJt2tsSw6lbFu9PVL/preview)

* __Black blood__: Can appear at the beginning or end of a person’s period. The colour is typically a sign of old blood or blood that has taken longer to leave the uterus and has had time to oxidise, first turning brown or dark red and then eventually becoming black
* __Brown blood or spotting__:  Can be spotted at the beginning or end of a period and it can sometimes also be an early sign of pregnancy. 
* __Orange or grey blood__: May indicate an infection.

However, everyone’s period is different, and blood can change colour and consistency during a period and from month to month. Healthy period blood typically varies from bright red to dark brown or black. Women who experience bleeding during pregnancy should see a doctor or obstetrician for an evaluation.

It's advisable to consult a doctor if you experience any unusual symptoms such as:

* New or unusual vaginal discharge
* Irregular periods that change in length and flow
* Bleeding after menopause
* Missing three or more periods
* Thick gray or white vaginal discharge
* Itching in or around the vagina
* Fever

# Understanding Reproductive Health Disorders: PCOS and Endometriosis

![Reproductive](https://)
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries. Understanding PCOS can help in managing its symptoms and improving overall health.

## What Is PCOS?

PCOS is a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens, which are male sex hormones that are typically present in women in small amounts. It is called "polycystic" because many small, fluid-filled sacs (cysts) form in the ovaries. These cysts are not harmful but can lead to hormone imbalances.

### Causes of PCOS

The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but several factors may play a role, including:

* __Genetics__: PCOS often runs in families.
* __Insulin Resistance__: Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance, which means their bodies cannot use insulin effectively, leading to higher insulin levels. Excess insulin may increase androgen production.
* __Inflammation__: Increased levels of inflammation have been linked to higher androgen levels.


### Symptoms of PCOS

The symptoms of PCOS can vary, but common signs include:
Irregular Periods: Infrequent, irregular, or prolonged menstrual cycles.

* __Excess Androgen__: Elevated levels of male hormones can lead to physical signs such as excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), severe acne, and male-pattern baldness.
* __Polycystic Ovaries__: Enlarged ovaries containing numerous small cysts.
* __Weight Gain__: Difficulty losing weight or unexplained weight gain.
* __Skin Changes__: Darkening of the skin, particularly along neck creases, in the groin, and underneath breasts.
* __Fertility Issues__: Difficulty getting pregnant due to irregular ovulation or anovulation.


### Diagnosing PCOS

There is no single test to diagnose PCOS. A diagnosis is usually made based on:

* __Medical History__: Detailed questions about menstrual cycles, weight changes, and other symptoms.
* __Physical Exam__: Checking for signs of excess hair growth, insulin resistance, and acne.
* __Blood Tests__: Measuring hormone levels, including androgens, and assessing blood sugar and cholesterol levels.
* __Pelvic Exam__: Examining the reproductive organs for abnormalities.
* __Ultrasound__: Checking the appearance of the ovaries and the thickness of the uterine lining.


### Managing PCOS

While there is no cure for PCOS, its symptoms can be managed with lifestyle changes and medical treatments.

**Lifestyle Changes**

* __Healthy Diet__: Eating a balanced diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Reducing sugar and refined carbohydrates can help manage insulin levels.
* __Regular Exercise__: Engaging in regular physical activity to help manage weight and improve insulin sensitivity.
* __Weight Management__: Losing even a small amount of weight can improve symptoms and help regulate menstrual cycles.

### Medical Treatments:

* __Hormonal Contraceptives__: Birth control pills, patches, or vaginal rings can regulate menstrual cycles, reduce androgen levels, and clear acne.
* __Anti-Androgens__: Medications such as spironolactone can reduce hair growth and clear acne.
* __Metformin__: A medication that improves insulin sensitivity and can help with weight loss and menstrual regularity.
* __Fertility Treatments__: For women struggling with infertility, treatments like clomiphene or letrozole can stimulate ovulation.


## Managing PCOS Naturally
Some women prefer to manage their PCOS symptoms naturally through:

* __Herbal Supplements__: Supplements such as inositol, cinnamon, and spearmint tea have shown promise in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing androgen levels.
* __Acupuncture__: Some studies suggest that acupuncture can help regulate menstrual cycles and improve ovulation.
* __Stress Management__: Practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness can reduce stress, which may help balance hormones.

# Endometriosis

**What Is Endometriosis?**

![Endometriosis](https://wemasomo.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffirebasestorage.googleapis.com%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fshe-masomo.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fimg%252Fexplore%252Fendometriosis%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D149829e8-ed49-40d8-a776-7d693b7d2424&w=1920&q=75)
Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It can cause severe pain in the pelvis and make it harder to get pregnant. Endometriosis can start at a person’s first menstrual period and last until menopause. With endometriosis, tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. This leads to inflammation and scar tissue forming in the pelvic region and (rarely) elsewhere in the body.


## What Causes Endometriosis?

The cause of endometriosis is unknown. There is no known way to prevent endometriosis. There is no cure, but its symptoms can be treated with medicines or, in some cases, surgery. It causes a chronic inflammatory reaction that may result in the formation of scar tissue (adhesions, fibrosis) within the pelvis and other parts of the body. Several lesion types have been described:

* Superficial endometriosis found mainly on the pelvic peritoneum
* Cystic ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma) found in the ovaries
* Deep endometriosis found in the recto-vaginal septum, bladder, and bowel
* In rare cases, endometriosis has also been found outside the pelvis.

## What Are The Symptoms?

Endometriosis often causes severe pain in the pelvis, especially during menstrual periods. Some people also have pain during sex or when using the bathroom. Some people have trouble getting pregnant.

Some people with endometriosis don’t have any symptoms. For those who do, a common symptom is pain in the lower part of the belly (pelvis). Pain may be most noticeable:

* During a period
* During or after sex
* When urinating or defecating

Some people also experience:

* Chronic pelvic pain
* Heavy bleeding during periods or between periods
* Trouble getting pregnant
* Bloating or nausea
* Fatigue
* Depression or anxiety

Symptoms often improve after menopause, but not always. Endometriosis symptoms are variable and broad, meaning that healthcare workers may not easily diagnose it. Individuals with symptoms may not be aware of the condition. Other factors may also contribute to the growth or persistence of ectopic endometrial tissue. For example, endometriosis is known to be dependent on estrogen, which increases the inflammation, growth, and pain associated with the disease. However, the relationship between estrogen and endometriosis is complex since the absence of estrogen does  not always mean the absence of endometriosis.


# Menstrual Hygiene and Products

Maintaining proper menstrual hygiene is essential for overall health and comfort during menstruation. Understanding the different menstrual hygiene products and how to use them can help in managing periods effectively

## Sanitary Pads (Pads)

**Description**

Sanitary pads are absorbent products worn inside the underwear to collect menstrual blood. They come in various sizes, thicknesses, and absorbency levels.

**How to Use**

* Choose a pad with appropriate absorbency for your flow (light, regular, or heavy).
* Peel off the adhesive strip on the back of the pad.
* Place the pad sticky side down in the center of your underwear.
* If the pad has wings, fold them around the sides of your underwear to secure it in place.


**Hygiene Tips**

* Change pads every 4-6 hours or more frequently if the pad is soaked.
* Always wash your hands before and after changing pads.
* Dispose of used pads properly by wrapping them in toilet paper or the wrapper from the new pad and placing them in a trash bin.

## Tampons

**Description**

Tampons are cylindrical absorbent products inserted into the vagina to absorb menstrual blood. They come with or without applicators and in various absorbency levels.

**How to Use**

* Choose a tampon with the right absorbency for your flow.
* If using an applicator, hold the applicator with your thumb and middle finger, and place the tip at the entrance of your vagina.
* Gently push the applicator inside until your fingers touch your body, then use your index finger to push the inner tube of the applicator, releasing the tampon.
* If using a non-applicator tampon, insert the tampon using your finger, ensuring it sits comfortably in the vaginal canal.
* Always leave the string hanging outside for easy removal.


**Hygiene Tips**

* Change tampons every 4-8 hours to reduce the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS).
* Wash your hands before and after inserting or removing a tampon.
* Never flush tampons down the toilet; wrap them in toilet paper and dispose of them in a trash bin.


## Menstrual Cups

**Description**

Menstrual cups are flexible, reusable cups made of medical-grade silicone, rubber, or latex inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual blood.

**How to Use**

* Choose the right size cup based on your age, childbirth history, and flow.
* Fold the cup in a C-fold or punch-down fold for insertion.
* Insert the folded cup into the vagina, aiming toward the base of your spine.
* Once inside, the cup will open up and create a seal against the vaginal walls.
* To remove, pinch the base of the cup to break the seal and gently pull it out.

**Hygiene Tips**

* Empty the cup every 6-12 hours, depending on your flow.
* Rinse the cup with water or mild soap and reinsert it.
* Sterilize the cup by boiling it in water for 5-10 minutes at the end of your cycle.


## Menstrual Discs

**Description**

Menstrual discs are flexible discs worn inside the vagina, positioned at the cervix to collect menstrual blood. They can be disposable or reusable.

**How to Use**

* Squeeze the sides of the disc together to make it narrower for insertion.
* Push the folded disc into the vagina, aiming it toward the cervix.
* Tuck the front edge of the disc behind the pubic bone to secure it in place.
* To remove, hook a finger under the front edge of the disc and gently pull it out.

**Hygiene Tips**

* Change disposable discs every 12 hours or as needed.
* For reusable discs, rinse with water and mild soap between uses and sterilize after each cycle.
* Always wash your hands before and after handling the disc.

## Period Panties

**Description**

Period panties are specially designed underwear with built-in absorbent layers to absorb menstrual blood. They come in various styles and absorbency levels.

**How to Use**

Wear period panties like regular underwear.
Choose the appropriate absorbency level for your flow (light, medium, or heavy).

**Hygiene Tips**

* Rinse period panties in cold water after use to remove excess blood.
* Wash them in the washing machine using mild detergent, but avoid using fabric softeners or bleach.
* Air dry to prolong the life of the panties.

## Additional Menstrual Hygiene Tips

* __Bathing and Cleaning__: Take regular showers or baths to maintain hygiene. Clean the genital area with water and mild, unscented soap. Avoid douching as it can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria and yeast in the vagina.
* __Clothing__: Wear clean, breathable cotton underwear to reduce the risk of infections and irritation. Change underwear daily.
* __Hydration and Diet__: Drink plenty of water and maintain a balanced diet to support overall health and reduce menstrual discomfort.
* __Exercise__: Engage in regular physical activity to improve blood circulation and reduce menstrual cramps.
* __Tracking__: Use a period tracking app or calendar to monitor your menstrual cycle, which can help you anticipate and manage your period better. You can access a period tracker from wemasomo.com


# Typical Questions

* How will I know when my periods are going to start?

Signs that your period is approaching include growing underarm and pubic hair. Generally, you'll start your periods about 2 years after your breasts begin to grow and about a year after experiencing a white vaginal discharge. Most girls get their first period around 12 years old, though this can vary.

* Why have my periods not started yet?

Your period will begin when your body is ready, typically between ages 10 and 16 or about 2 years after your initial signs of puberty. Delayed periods can be due to factors like being underweight, excessive exercise, stress, or hormonal imbalances. Consult a doctor if your period hasn’t started by age 16.

* How do I get ready for my first period?

Speak with your parents, guardians, or a trusted adult about what to expect. Start carrying sanitary pads or tampons with you. If you find yourself at school without a pad or tampon, ask a teacher or school nurse for help.

* How long will my first period last and how much blood will I lose?

Your first period might be shorter and less regular as your body adjusts. Typically, once regular, periods last 3 to 7 days and occur every 28 to 30 days. The amount of blood is about 3 to 5 tablespoons, and it may appear as reddish-brown stains on your clothing or sheets.

* Should I use pads, tampons, or menstrual cups?

This choice is personal. Pads, tampons, and menstrual cups are all safe options for those just starting their periods. Pads might be more comfortable at first as tampons and cups can take time to get used to. Experiment to find what works best for you.

* Can a tampon get lost inside me?

No, a tampon cannot get lost. It stays in the vagina and has a string for easy removal. If you have difficulty removing it, seek help from a healthcare professional.

* What if I forget to remove my tampon?

If you forget to remove a tampon, it might turn sideways or become compressed, making it harder to remove. If you can’t get it out, see a doctor for assistance.
