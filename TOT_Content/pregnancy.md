Pregnancy is the process that occurs when a fertilized egg implants and develops into a baby inside a woman’s uterus. It typically lasts around 40 weeks, counting from the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period (LMP), and is divided into three stages known as trimesters.

## How Does Pregnancy Occur?

* Ovulation: Each month, an ovary releases an egg into the fallopian tube in a process called ovulation.

* Fertilization: If sperm is present in the fallopian tube, it may fertilize the egg. Fertilization usually happens in the fallopian tube and results in the formation of a zygote.
* Implantation: The fertilized egg, now called a blastocyst, travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus. It implants itself into the lining of the uterus, where it will grow and develop into an embryo and later a fetus.
* Development: The fertilized egg undergoes rapid cell division and starts forming the placenta and amniotic sac. The placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby, and the amniotic sac cushions and protects it.

Throughout pregnancy, a woman's body undergoes many changes to support the growth and development of the baby. Understanding these changes and knowing how to take care of oneself during this time is crucial for a healthy pregnancy and delivery.

## Common Signs of Pregnancy.

* __Missed Period__
One of the most noticeable and common early signs of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. If your periods are usually regular and you miss one, it could be a sign that you are pregnant.


* __Nausea and Vomiting__
Often referred to as morning sickness, nausea and vomiting can occur at any time of the day. This typically starts around the sixth week of pregnancy but can begin as early as the fourth week.


* __Breast Changes__
During early pregnancy, hormonal changes might make your breasts tender, swollen, or sore. The areolas (the area around the nipples) may darken and increase in diameter.


* __Fatigue__
Feeling unusually tired is a common symptom in the first trimester. This is due to high levels of the hormone progesterone, which can make you feel sleepy.


* __Frequent Urination__
As your pregnancy progresses, the growing uterus puts pressure on your bladder, causing more frequent urination. This can start as early as six weeks into pregnancy.


* __Food Aversions or Cravings__
Pregnancy can make you very sensitive to certain smells and cause aversions to some foods. Conversely, you might crave foods you didn't care for before.


* __Mood Swings__
The flood of hormones in your body in early pregnancy can make you unusually emotional and weepy. Mood swings are common, especially in the first trimester.


* __Bloating__
Hormonal changes during early pregnancy can cause you to feel bloated, similar to how you might feel at the start of a menstrual period.


* __Light Spotting and Cramping__
Some women experience light spotting and cramping as the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. This is known as implantation bleeding and occurs around 10 to 14 days after conception.


* __Constipation__
Hormonal changes cause your digestive system to slow down, which can lead to constipation.


* __Dizziness and Fainting__
Pregnancy causes blood vessels to dilate and blood pressure to drop, leading to dizziness or fainting. Low blood sugar can also contribute to these symptoms.


* __Increased Basal Body Temperature__
If you have been tracking your basal body temperature to determine ovulation, you may notice that it remains elevated throughout your pregnancy.





## When to Take a Pregnancy Test.

If you notice any of these signs and suspect you might be pregnant, taking a home pregnancy test can confirm your suspicions or you can schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to confirm the pregnancy.

## First Trimester (1 to 13 weeks)

The first trimester begins on the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP) and lasts until the end of the 13th week.
