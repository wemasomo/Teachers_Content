## Prevention

### Condoms(Male)

Condoms are the only contraceptive method that protects against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
They are designed to stop a man's semen from meeting his sexual partner. They can be used by men having sex with women or men.
Suitable for unplanned sex - no preparation and are easy to put on. 
They are offered for free at some medical centres.

How To Use:
-----------

The male condom is a sheath or covering that is worn over the penis during sex. Each condom can only be used once, so protection only lasts as long as the condom is intact and worn on the penis. To prevent pregnancy the condom must stop any sperm from reaching the vagina. Putting on the condom late or removing the condom during sex will result in a much higher risk of pregnancy.

Side Effects:
-------------

None.

If you are sensitive to latex, you can use non-latex condoms instead.

Good to Know:
-------------

They are easy to carry around in your wallet or pocket. Condoms are a good method of contraception if you remember to keep them with you when you think you are going to have sex. You should also be confident about using them or asking your partner to use them

### Condoms(Female)

Condoms are the only type of contraception that protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV as well as pregnancy. Female condoms (often called ‘Femidom’) are made from very thin soft plastic called polyurethane and are worn inside the vagina to prevent sperm getting to the womb. They are offered for free at some medical centers around.

How To Use:
-----------

Take the female condom out of the packet, taking care not to tear it. Squeeze the smaller ring at the closed end and insert it into the top of the vagina, up to 8 hours before sex. Make sure that the large ring at the open end of the female condom covers the area around the vaginal opening. When you are having sex, make sure that the penis enters the condom. Remove the condom immediately after sex by gently pulling it out and twisting the large ring to prevent sperm leaking out.

Side Effects:
-------------

None.

If you're sensitive to the latex used in male condoms, you can use female condoms Also when you want to make sure to be protected, and being in control of the contraception method you can use female condoms.

Good To Know:
-------------

Condoms are a good method of contraception if you remember to keep them with you when you think you are going to have sex. You should also be confident about using them or asking your partner to use them.

### Pill

The pill is a small round tablet that releases a progestogen hormone. It has to be taken daily. It may help with premenstrual symptoms or painful periods. You are protected from pregnancy straight away if you start taking it on the first day of your period every month. When you stop using the pill your fertility will return to normal and you can get pregnant. Can be bought at a pharmacy or medical center. 

How To Use:
-----------

You will need to take one pill every day. There are 28 pills per pack, and you do not take a break between packs. Choose a convenient time in the day to take your first pill and continue to take it at the same time every day. You need to remember to take your pill every day. The chance of getting pregnant depends on when the pills are missed and how many pills are missed, there are long lasting contraception options available.

Side Effects:
-------------

Although serious side effects are not common, there are some risks associated. Rashes, breast tenderness, nausea/vomiting, stomach upset, weight change and headaches, change to sex drive or mood could occur. These should go after a few months of use.

Good To Know:
-------------

When you stop using the pill your fertility will return to normal.
The pill does not protect you from STIs. You should use a condom as well if you think you are at risk of an STI.

### Emergency Pill

The emergency contraception pill (sometimes called the ‘morning after pill’) can be taken after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy. There are two types of hormonal emergency contraception; one which has to be taken within three days of unprotected sex, and the other within five days. The emergency contraceptive pill is by far the most popular method of emergency contraception and can be bought from most pharmacies.

How To Use:
-----------

The pills should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. However, they can still be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex.If you’re sick (vomit) within two hours of taking the pill, seek medical advice as you will need to take another dose. These pills contain ingredients which prevent or delay ovulation (the egg being released from your ovaries).

Side Effects:
-------------

There are no serious side effects of using emergency contraceptive pills. It reduces the risk of pregnancy if you are not on any other form of contraception, or if your contraception has failed. Your next period may be earlier or later than usual. It can also make you feel sick, dizzy, or tired, or give you a headache, tender breasts, or abdominal pain. Using the emergency contraceptive pill repeatedly can disrupt your regular menstrual cycle.

Good To Know:
-------------

Emergency contraceptive pills do not protect against STIs and HIV. You should use condoms to protect yourself from STIs and HIV,

### Coil

The non-hormonal coil, also known as the IUD (intrauterine device) or ‘copper coil’, is a small T-shaped device that sits in your womb. It is long-acting but can be easily removed if you decide you want to become pregnant or use alternative contraception. The hormonal coil, also known as Mirena is a T shaped plastic device that sits in your womb. It contains Levonorgestrel which is a progestin hormone. 

How To Use:
-----------

Most women can use the IUD, but your clinician will ask about your family and medical history to determine whether it is the best method for you.

It may not be suitable for women who have:

- Heavy periods
- Allergy to copper
- Pelvic infection
- Unexplained vaginal bleeding
- Fibroids.

Side Effects:
-------------

Some women may experience cramps and spotting/bleeding for a few days after getting the coil. Periods may become heavier or more painful, though this should settle after a few months.
One may also experience irregular bleeding for up to  six months.

Good To Know:
-------------

The IUD does not protect you from STIs or HIV. You should use a condom as well if you think you are at risk of an STI.

### Injection

The contraceptive injection contains the hormone progesterone and offers short-term prevention of pregnancy. The contraceptive injection does not protect you from STIs, you should use a condom as well if you think you are at risk of an STI. May reduce heavy or painful periods. You don’t have to prepare for or interrupt sex. You don’t have to remember to take a pill everyday.

How To Use:
-----------

Works for up to 13 weeks (depending on type used) and is injected by a healthcare provider.

Side Effects:
-------------

It can take up to one year for your fertility and periods to return to normal after the injection wears off, so it may not be suitable if you want to have a baby in the near future. Additional side effects can be; weight gain, headaches, mood swings, breast tenderness and irregular bleeding.

Good To Know:
-------------

The injection is not suitable for women who:

- Are pregnant.
- Want to become pregnant within the next year.
- Want regular periods.
- Have bleeding in between periods or after sex.
- Are at risk of osteoporosis.

It may not be suitable for women who have or have had certain health conditions.

### Withdrawal.

It is free and does not require you to take or use any hormone treatment. Withdrawal does not prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are the only effective method of protection against STIs. Withdrawal acts as a form of natural contraception as the man withdraws his penis before ejaculation so that no sperm enters the woman’s vagina.

Some sperm can be released in pre-ejaculate, so there is still a chance of pregnancy, even if the man ejaculates outside the vagina. Withdrawal also interrupts sex (and is a bit messy), so can be less pleasurable for one or both partners.

How To Use:
-----------

Withdrawal relies on the man being able to fully pull out at the right moment. The point of ejaculation can be difficult to predict and control.

It is very difficult to judge when ejaculation is going to happen, and some sperm in the pre-ejaculate can still reach the egg, so it’s an unreliable way to prevent pregnancy.

You also need to consider where the man is going to ejaculate - this might be onto a towel, the bed, or onto his partner’s body. In any case, it is going to be messy, and some people may find it unpleasant. You should discuss with your partner beforehand to make sure that you both feel comfortable.Withdrawal should not be used as a long-term method of contraception.

Side Effects:
-------------

There is a risk of pregnancy as withdrawal is difficult to perform correctly.

Good To Know:
-------------

Withdrawal is suitable for anyone who feels comfortable discussing and agreeing with their partner that they will use this method.
Condoms are the only effective method of protection against STIs.

## Safe Days

### Menstrual Cycle

The Menstrual Cycle is the time from the first day of a woman’s period bleeding to the day before her next period. The length of the menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman, but the average cycle length is 28 days. Some regular menstrual cycles can vary and be about 21 to 40 days,and this is normal.

Most girls start their periods when they're about 12 years old, but they can start as early as 8. The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones. When a girl starts her period it's a sign that her body is now able to conceive. Therefore, it's important that she also knows about getting pregnant and contraception methods.

Irregular periods aren't always a sign of a problem as the menstrual cycle can vary from person to person. Some women do not always have a regular menstrual cycle. Their period may be early or late, and how long it lasts and how heavy it is may vary each time.

After puberty, many women develop a regular cycle with a similar length of time between periods but it's not uncommon for it to vary by a few days each time.

> What happens during the menstrual cycle?
>
> A period is made up of blood and the uterine lining. The first day of a woman's period is day 1 of the menstrual cycle. Some women bleed more heavily during the first day of their period.

In each cycle, rising levels of the hormone estrogen cause one of the two ovaries to develop and release an egg from the ovary which is known as ovulation. The egg travels through the fallopian tubes to the uterus. 

The uterus lining starts to thicken in the second half of the cycle and if fertilization of the egg by a sperm does not occur then the egg is reabsorbed into the body, and the uterine lining comes away and leaves the body as a period blood (the menstrual flow).
The time from the release of an egg to the start of a period is around 10 to 16 days.

Some women experience irregular periods and some common causes for this can be:

- Puberty - your periods might be irregular for the first year or two.
- Menopause - usually between the ages of 45 and 55.
- Early pregnancy - take a pregnancy test in case of a late or missed period.
- Some types of hormonal contraception – such as the contraceptive pill can cause changes to the menstrual cycle.
- Extreme weight loss or weight gain, excessive exercise, or stress can also be a factor.
- Endometriosis or PCOS- Can lead to irregular cycles.

- You can also use the period tracker to keep track of symptoms such as mood swings, heaviness of the period flow, abdominal cramps, spotting, backaches.

### Menstrual Pain.

One may experience pain during menstruation. This is common and a normal part of the menstrual cycle. Most women get it at some point in their lives.
It's usually felt as painful muscle cramps in the abdomen which can spread to the back and thighs.
The pain sometimes comes in intense spasms, while at other times it may be dull but more constant.
Period pain usually starts when your bleeding begins, although some women have pain several days before the start of their period. It's usually at its worst when your bleeding is heaviest.
Young girls often have period pain when they first get their periods.

#### When Does It Happen?

Period pain happens when the muscular wall of the uterus tightens (contracts). Mild contractions continually occur in your womb, but they're usually so mild that most women cannot feel them.
During your period, the wall of the uterus starts to contract to help the uterine lining to shed as part of your period.
When the uterine walls contract, it compresses the blood vessels lining the uterus.

#### How To Reduce The Pain?

To reduce the pain, you could try: 

- Over the counter painkillers.
- Stopping smoking.
- Massage - light, circular massage around your lower abdomen may also help reduce pain
- Relaxing activities and gentle movement, may help distract you from feelings of pain and discomfort.
- Hot Water Bottles.
- Topical Painkillers.

#### Typical Questions.

* __How will I know when my periods are going to start?__

  Signs that your period is on its way are if you've grown underarm and pubic hair. Typically, you'll start your periods about 2 years after your breasts start growing and about a year after getting a white vaginal discharge. The average girl will get her first period around 12 years old, but it varies from person to person.


* __Why have my periods not started yet?__

  Your period will start when your body is ready. This is usually between age 10 and 16, or 2 years after your first signs of puberty.
Possible reasons for delayed periods include being underweight, doing lots of exercise, stress, and a hormone imbalance.
See a doctor if your periods have not started by age 16.

* __How do I get ready for my first period?__

  Talk to your parents/guardians or another adult you trust about what you can expect before it actually happens.

  It's a good idea to start carrying sanitary pads or tampons around with you in advance.

  If you find yourself at school without a pad or tampon, ask a teacher or the school nurse for some.

* __How long will my first period last and how much blood will I lose?__

  Your first period might not last very long, as it can take your body some months to get into a regular pattern. As a general rule, once they're settled, you'll have a period every 28 to 30 days and it will last 3 to 7 days.

  It might seem a lot, but it's only about 3 to 5 tablespoons. It's not a sudden gush – you'll just see a reddish-brown stain on your pants or on your sheets when you wake up in the morning.

* __Should I use pads, tampons, or menstrual cups?__

  This is up to you. Tampons, menstrual cups, and pads (hygiene towels) are safe and suitable if you’ve just started your period. You might want to use pads for your very first period as tampons and cups can take some time getting used to. It might be worth experimenting until you find the product that suits you best.

* __Can a tampon get lost inside me?__

  No, it can't. When you insert a tampon, it stays in your vagina. All tampons come with a string at one end that stays outside your body. You can remove the tampon at any time using this string.

* __What if I forget to remove my tampon?__

  If you forget to remove your tampon, it can turn sideways or become compressed at the top of your vagina. This can make it difficult for you to pull it out. If you think you've left a tampon in and you can't get it out, go to your doctor. They can remove it for you.

### Non Appearance of The Menstrual Cycle/Missing or Delayed Period.

There are many reasons why a woman may miss her period, or why periods might stop altogether. Pregnancy is a common reason why periods unexpectedly stop. You might miss a period every so often if you're taking the contraceptive pill. This is not usually a cause for concern.
Periods can also sometimes stop as a result of a medical condition, such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, an overactive thyroid, or premature menopause.The average age for menopause, when periods stop, is 50 to 55 years.

There are several reasons why your periods can stop. The most common reasons are:

* Pregnancy
* Stress
* Sudden weight loss
* Being overweight
* Doing too much exercise
* Taking the contraceptive pill
* Menopause
* Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

### Menstrual Blood Colour

During menstruation, the body sheds tissue and blood from the uterus through the vagina. This bloody discharge can vary from bright red to dark brown or black depending on how old it is. Hormonal changes and health conditions can also affect the colour and texture of period blood. Hormonal changes, as well as a person’s diet, lifestyle, age, and environment, can all cause variations in period blood. Period blood can vary from bright red to dark brown according to changes in flow. 

Black blood can appear at the beginning or end of a person’s period. The colour is typically a sign of old blood or blood that has taken longer to leave the uterus and has had time to oxidise, first turning brown or dark red and then eventually becoming black.

Brown blood or spotting can sometimes also be an early sign of pregnancy. However, everyone’s period is different, and blood can change colour and consistency during a period and from month to month.
Healthy period blood typically varies from bright red to dark brown or black. Blood or discharge that is orange or grey may indicate an infection.

Women who experience bleeding during pregnancy should see a doctor or obstetrician for an evaluation.

Good To Know:
-------------

It is advisable for people to consult a doctor if any of the following symptoms occur:

* New or unusual vaginal discharge
* Irregular periods that change in length and flow from one month to the next
* Bleeding after menopause
* Missing three or more periods
* Thick gray or white vaginal discharge
* Itching in or around the vagina
* Fever

## Diseases

### Endometriosis

Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It can cause severe pain in the pelvis and make it harder to get pregnant.

Endometriosis can start at a person’s first menstrual period and last until menopause.

With endometriosis, tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. This leads to inflammation and scar tissue forming in the pelvic region and (rarely) elsewhere in the body.

The cause of endometriosis is unknown. There is no known way to prevent endometriosis. There is no cure, but its symptoms can be treated with medicines or, in some cases, surgery.

It causes a chronic inflammatory reaction that may result in the formation of scar tissue (adhesions, fibrosis) within the pelvis and other parts of the body. Several lesion types have been described:

* superficial endometriosis found mainly on the pelvic peritoneum
* cystic ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma) found in the ovaries
* deep endometriosis found in the recto-vaginal septum, bladder, and bowel
* in rare cases, endometriosis has also been found outside the pelvis.

Symptoms:
---------

Endometriosis often causes severe pain in the pelvis, especially during menstrual periods. Some people also have pain during sex or when using the bathroom. Some people have trouble getting pregnant.

Some people with endometriosis don’t have any symptoms. For those who do, a common symptom is pain in the lower part of the belly (pelvis). Pain may be most noticeable:  

* during a period
* during or after sex
* when urinating or defecating.
* Some people also experience:

  * chronic pelvic pain
  * heavy bleeding during periods or between periods
  * trouble getting pregnant
  * bloating or nausea
  * fatigue
  * depression or anxiety.

* Symptoms often improve after menopause, but not always.

Endometriosis symptoms are variable and broad, meaning that healthcare workers may not easily diagnose it. Individuals with symptoms may not be aware of the condition.

Causes:
-------

Endometriosis is a complex disease that affects many women globally from the onset of their first period through menopause, regardless of ethnic origin or social status. Many different factors are thought to contribute to its development. At present endometriosis is thought to arise due to:

Retrograde menstruation is when menstrual blood containing endometrial cells flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity at the time that blood is flowing out of the body through the cervix and vagina during periods. Retrograde menstruation can result in endometrial-like cells being deposited outside the uterus where they can implant and grow. Cellular metaplasia is when cells change from one form to another. Cells outside the uterus change into endometrial-like cells and start to grow. Stem cells can give rise to the disease, which then spreads through the body via blood and lymphatic vessels.
Other factors may also contribute to the growth or persistence of ectopic endometrial tissue. For example, endometriosis is known to be dependent on estrogen, which increases the inflammation, growth and pain associated with the disease. However, the relationship between estrogen and endometriosis is complex since the absence of estrogen does not always mean the absence of endometriosis.

### Cervical Cancer.

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally. Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Women living with HIV are 6 times more likely to develop cervical cancer compared to women without HIV. 

Causes:
-------

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection which can affect the skin, genital area and throat. Almost all sexually active people will be infected at some point in their lives, usually without symptoms.
In most cases the immune system clears HPV from the body. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV can cause abnormal cells to develop, which go on to become cancer.

Persistent HPV infection of the cervix (the lower part of the uterus or womb, which opens into the vagina  if left untreated, causes 95% of cervical cancers. Typically, it takes 15–20 years for abnormal cells to become cancer, but in women with weakened immune systems, such as untreated HIV, this process can be faster and take 5–10 years.

Prevention:

* Being vaccinated at age 9–14 years is a highly effective way to prevent HPV infection, cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers.
* Screening from the age of 30 (25 years in women living with HIV) can detect cervical disease, which when treated, also prevents cervical cancer.
* At any age with symptoms or concerns, early detection followed by prompt quality treatment can cure cervical cancer.
Other important ways to prevent HPV infection include:

  * being a non-smoker or stopping smoking
  * using condoms
  * voluntary male circumcision

Good To Know:
-------------

As of 2023, there are 6 HPV vaccines available globally. All protect against the high-risk HPV types 16 and 18, which cause most cervical cancers and have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing HPV infection and cervical cancer.

As a priority, HPV vaccines should be given to all girls aged 9–14 years, before they become sexually active.

### HIV

A new report shows that Kenya has had the fastest-growing number of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa in the last decade. It shows that between 2005 and 2015, the number of new HIV cases grew by an average of 7.1 per cent per year in Kenya, one of the highest increases in the world. 

Something you really should worry about is that of the 72,000 new adult HIV infections recorded in 2015, more than 35,000 or 46 per cent, were among adolescents and young people aged between the ages of 15 to 24 years. 

Young women (aged 15-24) account for up to 21% of all new HIV infections with a prevalence of between 4 and 6 times higher than males of the same age. This is found across all groups and across all geographic areas, from young female sex workers and young women who inject drugs, to young women in bad relationships and young women in and out of school.  

* Every day an average of 97 young people is said to be infected with HIV.
* 76% people living with HIV are now aware of their status.
* 79% who know their status are on treatment.

In School:
----------

HIV and AIDS education has been part of the school curriculum in Kenya since 2003. However, a study shows that only 54% of young women and 64% of young men (aged 15-24) had comprehensive knowledge about HIV prevention.

How do I protect myself?
------------------------

HIV infection is dangerous because it can develop into AIDS. AIDS reduces the body's resilience to other diseases. New combination therapies can inhibit HIV and hence treat AIDS.  
There are many side effects during treatment. Untreated AIDS leads to death. You cannot get infected with HIV virus by kissing and hugging a person with AIDS or HIV. 

You can protect yourself when using a condom

__Use a condom.__

### Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal. Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milk-producing lobules of the breast. The earliest form (in situ) is not life-threatening and can be detected in early stages. Cancer cells can spread into nearby breast tissue (invasion). This creates tumours that cause lumps or thickening. 

Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs (metastasize). Metastasis can be life-threatening and fatal.

Who Is At Risk:
---------------

Approximately 99% of breast cancers occur in women and 0.5–1% of breast cancers occur in men.

Certain factors increase the risk of breast cancer including increasing age, obesity, harmful use of alcohol, family history of breast cancer, history of radiation exposure, reproductive history, tobacco use and postmenopausal hormone therapy.

Family history of breast cancer increases the risk of breast cancer, but most women diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a known family history of the disease. Lack of a known family history does not necessarily mean that a woman is at reduced risk.

Signs and Symptoms:
-------------------

Most people will not experience any symptoms when the cancer is still early hence the importance of early detection.

Breast cancer can have combinations of symptoms, especially when it is more advanced. The symptoms of breast cancer can include:

* a breast lump or thickening, often without pain 
* change in size, shape or appearance of the breast
* dimpling, redness, pitting or other changes in the skin
* change in nipple appearance or the skin surrounding the nipple (areola) 
* abnormal or bloody fluid from the nipple.

#### Self-examination:

Breast self-exam, or regularly examining your breasts on your own, can be an important way to find breast cancer early, when it’s more likely to be treated successfully. 

How to visually examine your breasts

* Remove your upper garments, including your bra.
* Stand squarely in front of a large mirror and place your hands on your hips.
* Look at your breasts to check for new changes in their symmetry, size, shape or volume.
* Look at your breast skin to check for dimpling, pitting, puckering or redness.
* Look at your nipples to check for new changes in their appearance, such as inversion or unusual discharge.
* Lift both arms over your head and repeat the visual inspection of your breasts.

How to manually examine your breasts while standing:

* Remain standing in front of the mirror.
* Use your right hand to check your left breast.
* Use the pads of your three middle fingers to feel your breast tissue by firmly pressing on every part of your breast and underarm area; follow a circular pattern to ensure that no area is missed.
* Check for lumps, masses, thickened areas, knots and changes in texture.
* Gently squeeze your nipple to check for unusual discharge.
* Repeat the manual inspection using your left hand to check your right breast.

How to manually examine your breasts while lying down:

* Lie face up on a bed or couch, place a pillow under your left shoulder and place your left hand behind your head.
* Use your right hand to check your left breast using the same techniques outlined above.
* Repeat the manual inspection while lying down using your left hand to check your right breast.

Researchers estimate that up to 40% of breast cancers are initially detected by a woman who felt a lump while performing a breast self-exam. Even so, the effectiveness of breast self-exams as a standalone screening method for breast cancer is subject to debate within the general medical community. Self-exams are not foolproof, and many breast cancers are found through other methods, such as mammography.

## Parenting

Helping Children understand one age group at a time:

Let’s talk about what is age appropriate. We have got a little breakdown for you of each age and what you should be talking about. Remember that these age ranges are general guidelines, and every child develops at their own pace. It's important to gauge your child's readiness and understanding before introducing each topic.

* Early Childhood (Ages 3-6)

  Body parts: Show your child the right names for body parts, including privates  (penis, breast, vagina, chest hair, pubic hair, and so forth), while stressing privacy and boundaries.

  Consent and personal boundaries: Begin teaching your child about consent and the importance of respecting individual boundaries.

* Middle Childhood (Ages 7-10)

  Reproduction and pregnancy: Introduce basic ideas of reproduction, explaining to them how babies are made and grow in the womb. Explain how babies are born by explaining how the reproductive system works. For example, "Your mother has a uterus in her stomach”. That is where you lived before you were born.

* Puberty: Talk about the physical and emotional changes that happen during adolescence, like body hair development, breast development, and testicular development for boys.

* Pre-Adolescence (Ages 11-12):

  Puberty and sexual development: Give them more detailed information about the physical changes that occur during puberty, including menstruation for girls, erections for boys, and hormonal changes and why they rapidly grow during puberty. 

  Safe and healthy relationships: Talk about the importance of respect, consent, and communication in relationships, both online and offline. Let them understand the danger of online platforms.

* __Adolescence (Ages 13+)__

  Safe sex and contraception methods: Give comprehensive information on safe sex practices, contraception methods, and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). You can connect them to specialists like mentors and gynaecologists.

__Online safety:__ Address the expected dangers of sharing personal information online, sexting, and the importance of setting boundaries in a digital relationship.

__What do they know?__ - Check the information they know so far
Talk about newspaper, articles, social media on sex and sexuality. Engage them in an intelligent conversation.

### How To Talk About Sex and Sexuality.

#### What is sexual health education?

Sex education is the provision of information about bodily development, sex, sexuality, and relationships, along with skills-building to help young people communicate about and make informed decisions regarding sex and their sexual health. Sex education should take place throughout the student's educational cycle, with information that is age- appropriate to their development and culture. 

Why is it important to talk about sex education with your child?
It is alarming to learn that a significant number of boys and girls in our society enter puberty without having received knowledge about sex-Ed. To promote your child's general growth and well-being, have open discussions with them about sex and sexuality. Here are some key reasons why having the "sex talk" is crucial, as well as some advice for parents on how to handle this crucial conversation with their children:

1. Start early

   Start discussions about body parts, consent, and boundaries during early childhood. Step by step introduce more topics and subjects as your child develops and their interest increases. By providing adequate and accurate information about sex reproductive health, and having relationships early, you can guarantee that your child has a strong foundation of information. This empowers them to make informed choices and shields them from possibly harmful misinterpretations. Because with internet and telephone access so promptly accessible nowadays, your child is probably going to get this information significantly sooner than you did as a child. Use age-appropriate language and ideas while talking about sensitive subjects.

2. Have many discussions:

   Openly talking about sex and relationships helps shape your child's mentalities and values towards sexuality. It allows you to impart healthy attitudes such as consent, values, and communication, which are important for keeping up healthy relationships all through their lives. Continue with open dialogue and make a safe space where your child feels happy with clarifying some pressing issues and offering their thoughts and concerns. It gives them trust and a safe space to open up and talk comfortably with you.

3. Building trust and openness:

   Engaging in sex-ed talk with your child reinforces the bond of trust between you. It shows that you are free to help and guide them in exploring their sexual development and relationships. Be non-judgmental and approachable, so your child feels open to talking about such topics with you.

5. Be informative and direct:

   When they pose questions, help them by answering and if you do not know the answer just tell them you will find out and seek external resources and support. Do not give the wrong answer.

Encourage your child to come to you with different kinds of questions and feedback that concern them.

### Child Sexual Abuse

This App is designed to support parents in having sensitive and important conversations with their children about sexual abuse. It also provides essential steps to take if a child discloses or is suspected of being sexually abused. Through these guidelines, parents may help their children understand the importance of individual boundaries, recognize signs of abuse, and take appropriate steps to ensure that they are secure and happy. Let's get this thing started!
Tell your child that it is not okay to have any "body secrets" at any time and that if someone threatens them, then they need to talk to a trusted adult (educator or parent) freely without any fear of being reprimanded. But it also then becomes your responsibility as an adult to honor and uphold that child's trust.

Establish Trust and Open Communication early:
To build a trusting relationship with your child as soon as possible, through open communication and support.
Let your child feel comfortable talking about any concerns or discomfort he may be experiencing; remind him that you're here to hear and believe them.
Choose the right time and place for the start of a discussion about Personal Safety, boundaries, and body Autonomy. Use age-appropriate language and concepts to ensure your child understands the topic.

Teach About Personal Boundaries:
--------------------------------

Educate your child about personal boundaries and the difference between appropriate and inappropriate touch.
Emphasise that their body belongs to them, and they have the right to say no to any uncomfortable or unwanted touches.
Let them express themselves freely.

You never discourage them from talking to you by punishing them for telling the truth. You're sending them negative reinforcement about the truth when you do this, and they'll start to hide it. Instead, encourage them to tell the truth and talk to you freely, so that when the need arises, they always let you in on the complete picture without hiding any facts from you. If they do, listen to them, respond to their input, and never forget their fears and apprehensions, especially if they are related to a person your child often interacts with without your supervision.

Teach About Safe and Unsafe Secrets:
------------------------------------

Talk to them about unsafe touching from the very beginning. At any point in time, anything they find uncomfortable is not okay. Teach your child about safe and unsafe secrets and explain that no one should ask them to keep a secret about forms of touching or inappropriate behaviour. Emphasise that they should inform their parent or trusted adult educator of any request for secrecy, particularly where it concerns the body.

Recognizing and Reporting Abuse:
--------------------------------

Teach your child to recognize signs of sexual abuse, such as sudden changes in behavior, fearfulness, inappropriate knowledge or behavior for their age, or physical symptoms.
Explain the importance of reporting abuse to a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or counsellor.

Responding to Disclosure:
-------------------------

If your child discloses that they have been sexually abused, stay calm and reassure them that they have done the right thing by telling you. 
Avoid placing blame or expressing anger toward the child, the abuser, or yourself.

Seek Professional Help and Support:
-----------------------------------

Consult a professional, such as a pediatrician, therapist, or counselor, experienced in dealing with child sexual abuse cases.
Report the abuse to local authorities, such as child protective services or the police, who can initiate an investigation.

Offer Emotional Support:
------------------------

Provide a safe and supportive environment for your child to express their feelings and emotions.
Validate their experiences and assure them that they are not at fault.

Maintain Ongoing Communication:
-------------------------------

Continuously engage in open and honest discussions about personal boundaries, safety, and healthy relationships.
Keep reassuring your child that their safety is a priority and that they can always come to you with any concerns.

Self-Care for Parents:
----------------------

Recognize the emotional impact that dealing with sexual abuse can have on parents.
Seek support for yourself through counselling, support groups, or other resources to help you cope and better support your child.

Conclusion:
-----------

Talking to your child about sexual abuse is a crucial step in protecting their safety and well-being. By establishing open communication, teaching about personal boundaries, and taking appropriate steps if abuse is suspected, you can help your children understand the importance of safety, report abuse, and seek support. You're not the only one going on this journey, and you must seek professional advice if you want to succeed. You and I can make a safe space for our children to flourish.

Myth Busting.

Myth 1: "Talking about sex will encourage my child to engage in sexual activity."
Fact: Research has shown that open and honest communication about sex delays the onset of sexual activity and promotes healthier decision-making. Discussing sex does not encourage it but equips adolescents with the knowledge and understanding to make informed choices.

Myth 2: "If I talk about sex with my child, they will think I encourage it."
Fact: Having conversations about sex does not imply approval or encouragement. It shows that you care about their well-being and want them to have accurate information, make responsible choices, and understand the importance of consent and boundaries.

Myth 3: "If my child knows about contraception, they will become sexually active."
Fact: Knowledge about contraception empowers adolescents to protect themselves if and when they choose to engage in sexual activity. It does not automatically lead to increased sexual activity. Discussing contraception is about promoting safety and responsible decision-making.

Myth 4: "Pornography provides an accurate representation of real-life sexual relationships."
Fact: Pornography does not reflect real-life relationships or sexual experiences. It is important to differentiate between fantasy and reality and discuss the unrealistic portrayal of sex in pornography. Encourage your child to seek healthy, respectful relationships based on open communication and consent.

Myth 5: "If I don't talk about sex, my child will learn everything they need to know from their peers or the internet."
Fact: While peers and the internet can provide information, they may not always offer accurate or reliable knowledge. By engaging in open conversations, you can provide your child with age-appropriate information, guidance, and context, helping them make informed decisions.

Myth 6: "Discussing sex with my child will make them uncomfortable or embarrassed."
Fact: It is normal for both parents and a child to feel a bit uncomfortable when discussing sex. However, creating a safe and non-judgmental environment, being sensitive to their feelings, and assuring them of your support can make these conversations more comfortable and beneficial.
